Boldmapper is an easy way to add a product locator to your application. Product locators are useful
for pointing your customers to where they can find your product in stores. They are great for mapping distributors,
resturant locations, or even food trucks.

== Description ==

With Boldmapper, you can build and manage a store locator for your application. All locations are managed via our
web interface at https://boldmapper.com. You can easily import existing locations, manually add new ones,
track store hours, add tag filters and custom attributes all in one place.

This plugin adds a Boldmapper shortcode and widget so you can integrate your map easily on any page.

== Installation ==

Installation should take only a few minutes.

1. Upload the `boldmapper` plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You can now access the Boldmapper admin panel under `Settings -> Boldmapper`. From there, you can
add a global default Map ID from https://boldmapper.com/dashboard. You can find your Map ID on the
General Settings tab for your map.

### Using the shortcode
Once your Map ID is added you can then use the `[boldmapper]` shortcode on any page to render a map. If you
have multiple maps and would like to specify a different map, you can override the global Map ID by specifying
it in the shortcode like `[boldmapper map="89fb1f31-b36f-4d98-9dc4-90e7dd92a2ad"]`.

### Using the widget
Widget availability will be based on your theme, but wherever you can add a widget you can select the Boldmapper
widget by clicking on `Add a Widget` and selecting `Boldmapper Store Locator`.
